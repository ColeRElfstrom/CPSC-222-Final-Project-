# CPSC-222-Final-Project-
In this project, which is the final project for my Gonzaga University Intro to Data Science CPSC 222 class, I compare my apple health data including steps, 
flights and distance to eachother. On top of this I agrregate the data into days of the week, and then visualize the data into plots. Lastly, I hypothesis test some 
possible relations and then create Knn and Decision Tree models on the data.
